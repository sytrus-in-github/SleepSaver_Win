# SleepSaver

by Torchlight

This is a bunch of scripts that I use to schedule auto-shutdown so as to win back some of my sleep time :)

3 tasks will be created in Task Scheduler:
* autoShutDown: 		shut down the computer at a specified time. (default 01:00)
* autoShutDownAlert: 	Alert the user 1 hour before the shut down and reappear each 15 mins
* autoShutDownRestore:	Reactivate autoShutDown if needed, checked after each login.

## usage:

To set up different tasks: 
	run install.vbs
To switch off temporarily / switch back on: 
	run switch.vbs
To uninstall SleepSaver:
	run uninstall.vbs
